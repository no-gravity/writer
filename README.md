It is simply a centered textarea on an empty html page.

This creates a couple of nice features for free:

- Hit F11 and the whole screen is just the writer.

- The font size can be change with ctrl+ and ctrl-

- The textarea can be resized with the mouse and
  by moving its lower right corner.
  While resizing it, it stays centered.
  
Load and Save buttons will appear when you move the mouse
to the upper left corner of the screen.

Currently, loading and saving is a but cumbersome as it
uses the download/upload functionality of the browser.
It could be made more convenient by using the filesystem
